## Readme

Hi there! Here are the files included:

- `README.md`: (you're reading me)
- `Tausworthe.py`: file of all code and functions related to my implementation of the Tausworthe generator.
- `Tausworthe_notebook.ipynb`: jupyter notebook of the report and code demonstration from `Tausworthe.py` 
- `Tausworthe_report.pdf`: extra pdf copy of the report because I'm paranoid.
- `environment.yml`: environment file just in case there's some funny business or problems when running code.
